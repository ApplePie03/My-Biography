        <h1 class="lead header1">My Autobiography</h1>
        <p class="text text1">
            My name is Filip Zintro and I was born on 17th of June, 2000 in Tirana, Albania. 
            I lived my childhood in Greece most of the time, sometimes going at my grandmother, Jane in Creta. 
            Currently I'm living in London, where I'm studying accounting at 
            University Of Westminster.
            Talking about the interests, they are represented by cars, and modifiying them. I inherited this passion from my dad, being a huge car guy, who loved classic vehicles a lot.

        <h2 class="lead header2">My family</h2>
        <p class="text text2">
            My father's name is Kotso Zintro and he was born on 27th of April, 1966 in Greece.
            He studied engineering and now he has his construction business. 
            My mother is Valentina Zintro, she was born in Greece, at the date of 28th of July, 1978.
            She works as a teacher and I am truly grateful for everything she did to me in all 
            of those years and I love her and my father very much.

        <h2 class="lead header3">About my childhood</h2>
        <p class="text text3">
            I spent my childhood in Kor√ße and Thessaloniki, among my other sisters, Ana and Nita, where I developed a huge passion for reading also, inspired by my lovely mom. 
            Most of the day I was playing football with my friends, being an experienced defender, even playing in my highschool's team. So far I consider that I'm very lucky
            to have this lovely and hard-working family that gave me everything I needed to be a kid, and a teenager later.
